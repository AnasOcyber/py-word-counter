# Py Word Counter Tool

Use ```python main.py``` to execute the file. 

The program will ask you to provide the path to the .txt file (something like this './file.txt'. In this case the file is in the current folder), so provide a text file and you are good to go.

The program will then ask you about the **stop words**. Stop words are words that are commonly used in a language but are generally considered to be of little value in determining the meaning of a sentence. Examples of stop words in English include "the," "and," "is," "in," and so on.

So here you have two options ```y / n```  (y for yes and n for no). In case of y, you have to enter all those words that you want to exclude from the text. The words should be **sperated by a space**.

So, fill in and see the result on the terminal.
